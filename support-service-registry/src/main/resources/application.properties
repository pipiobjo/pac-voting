# When the registry starts up it will complain, with a stacktrace, that there are no replica nodes
# for the registry to connect to. In a production environment, you will want more than one instance
# of the registry. For our simple purposes, however, it sufficies to disable the relevant logging.
#
# By default, the registry will also attempt to register itself, so you’ll need to disable that, as well.
#
# It’s a good convention to put this registry on a separate port when using it locally.
